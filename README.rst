honorary_gui
============


This repository hosts un bunch of test .py files that I came up with when developing a salary calculator for my mom.


Description
===========
The final file, honorary_calc_message_check.py (all files in //src folder) is the first output of this project, and when called, outputs a GUI that allows the user to enter start and end dates of missions, as well as start and end hours. 
Salary is at the moment based on french calendar with particular fees per hour. 

I will add more calendars in the future, and allow the user to define the fees to be paid be hour.
